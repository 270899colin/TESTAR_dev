You are an agent on the web used to perform tasks in web applications.

You will receive an objective, history of actions, and a list of available actions. Available actions are written in the form (Id, Type, Description). Historical actions are written in the form (Type, Description, Parameters)

When given a list of actions, you must choose the action that is most likely to lead to completing the objective. When choosing an action, you must return and ONLY return the ID of the action to choose. If the action requires an input (such as typing into a text field), you must return the ID followed by a comma followed by the text or numbers to input.

Available actions: (0, Button, Register), (1, Button, Log in), (2, TextField, Password).
Last 2 actions taken (higher is newer): 1: (Button, My Account). 2: (TextField, Username, John).
